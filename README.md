## Project Goals

Ludicrum is not just a collection of board games — it is being built as a 
reusable engine capable of supporting multiple rule sets and visual styles.
My goals are currently: 

- Expand the supported game library
- Improve modularity and scalability
- Redefine the meaning of organized game engine.
- Keep the layers as clean as possible.
- Add more board games
- Expand theme customization
- Improve engine capacity

## Notes

- All graphics were created from scratch.
- The entire codebase was rewritten from the ground up.
- Originally inspired by RyiSnow's YouTube tutorial. Seriously, check him out.
